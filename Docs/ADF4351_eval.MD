This document will include information on ADF4351 evaluation as main oscillator.


#Key Notes
- ADF 4351 can generate frequencies between 34 Mhz and 4GHz
- It has 2 RF output ports, both can be same or dividents of each other (1/2/4/8/16/32/64)
- We need to downconvert 739 MHz (LNB oputput with 9750 MHz local oscialltor)
- We need to upconvert to 2.4GHz (satellite input frequency)
- We need to choost IF frequencies that we can find SAW filters easily
- We need to choost IF frequencies that we can receive and/or transmit with self-made SDR transceiver (preferably HF, <50MHz)
